#The primary objective is to harness classification techniques to provide crucial assistance to physicians. By tapping into the vast reservoir of data within the healthcare industry, effective decision-making can be achieved by uncovering hidden patterns and relationships within the database. 

The dataset under consideration comprises 132 symptoms, whose combinations or permutations result in 41 different diseases [8]. Leveraging a dataset of 4920 patient records, our objective is to formulate a robust prediction model. This model is designed to accept input symptoms from the user and subsequently forecast the disease to which the user is more likely to be predisposed. The considered symptoms and diseases in the dataset are.

Method: The process encompasses data exploration, visualization and preprocessing, followed by the application of various machine learning algorithms, result analysis and model interpretability.
